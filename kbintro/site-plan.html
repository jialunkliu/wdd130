      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever felt the pain of your hands while you had to type for a long time? Well, I feel you. Nowadays, we are heavily using our computers to do our work. One main interaction we use to communicate with computers is through typing, and the keyboard is the main tool to achieve this. But do you know the design of the “standard” keyboard layout was designed for typewriters around 100 years ago? There is a more modern and ergonomic design called the “ortholinear” keyboard. “Ortho” is a Greek word meaning straight or rigid. Combined with linear, means something has a lot of straight lines. An ortholinear keyboard is more friendly to your fingers than the “standard” staggering keyboard. With this design, your fingers only need to move up and down in their columns. Let me show some of the keyboards that have this design and their pro and cons.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Those People who need to use keyboard for their work for a long period of time everyday. Someone who is interesting in learning more about the history of keyboard, and why it is design the way it is. Or someone who wants to type more comfortable and might be faster. </p>  <!-- change this -->

        Have you ever wondered why the standard computer keyboards we use today are designed the way they are? Take another device that also comes with input keys -- "calculator" for example, all the keys on a calculator, are all straight colons and rows. Why only a computer keyboard is designed staggering?<br>
        Where is the stagger design came from?<br>
        The design of the standard keyboard can trace back around 100 years ago, from the typewriter. The typewriter is built on a pure mechanism, there were no electronic components inside it. Your fingers are the power to make a typewriter function. Each key is connected to a lever. And the lever is connected to another lever called a type hammer, which has a reverse letter (like a little stamp) in the end. There is also a layer of a spool of inked cloth called a ribbon placed right before the paper. When you hit a key, the lever behind the key will bring the type hammer to hit the paper, with the ribbon the letter will be printed on the paper, like a stamp. This is just a simple explanation of how a typewriter work, if you want to know more, check this <br>
        Since a typewriter has so many levers behind its keyboard, there is no way that each colon can be lined up straight. In order to include all the levers, a staggering design was the best option. As time passed on, we had new technology, our keyboards don't have the mechanical levers and type hammer anymore, but this staggering design is kept and become the "standard" keyboard.<br>
        Feel the pain of your fingers?<br>
        If you type a lot on a standard keyboard, you might found that your fingers hurt after you type for a while. In the perspective of ergonomic, our finger moves straight up and down more easily than moving diagonally. You might wonder, no one ever thought about this problem in the past 100 years? Well, there is! Let me introduce you the "ortholinear" keyboard.<br>
        Ortholinear<br>
        "Ortho" is a Greek word meaning straight or rigid. Combined with linear, means something has a lot of straight lines. The YouTuber, "Ben Vallack" gives a really good explanation on this Ortholinear and stagger design:<br>
        It seems like the ortholinear keyboard is better than the standard staggered keyboard, but why you can't see them in a normal store, or you've probably never heard of them. Well, the main reason is the price. An ortholinear keyboard usually cost around $100~$250. If you don't need to type on a keyboard for a long time, you probably won't notice the unergonomic design of the standard keyboard. Since not too many people need them, fewer companies are willing to produce them, then the price would not be cheap. If you are interested in learning more about the Ortholinear keyboard, check out my other page, which I will introduce to you the ortholinear keyboard I have.<br>
 
        Another way to help release the pain of your finger while typing, is changing your keyboard layout, which is the cheapest way to do it. If you are interested, check out this page.

      <h3>Ortholinear Keyboard</h3>
      <p>
        If you are thinking to buy a ready-to-use ortholinear keyboard, there are not many options on the market. The main way to get an ortholinear keyboard is to build it yourselves! The only company I know that sells the complete product is the ZSA, they have three products, Planck EZ, Ergodox EZ, and the Moonlander.<br>
 
        There is a lot of ortholinear keyboard kit online you could find, pick one that you are interested in! The cheapest way is buying the DIY kit, in which you need to build it from soldering components to PCBs and flesh the software to the microcontroller. Most websites that sell DIY keyboard kits have a building guide for you, follow them step by step, and you should be able to build your keyboard without any issue. If you think that you can't do it, then there are also some keyboard that comes with a pre-build PCB, the only thing you need to do is find switches and keycaps and there you go! But it might cost more.<br>
 
        I have three ortholinear keyboards. They are a little bit more advance than just the ortholinear style, they are also split. My keyboards are: Ergodox, Sofle V1, and the Dactyl-ManuForm<br>
 
        Ergodox<br>
        Ergodox is a DIY keyboard project originally developed by Dox(Dominic Beauchamp). This is my first DIY keyboard, it's not cheap, it cost me around $200. This is the classic ortholinear and split keyboard. I enjoyed this keyboard a lot, but the problem is it is too big, I can't carry it around. It is hot-swappable, meaning that I can switch keys if I want.<br>
 
        Sofle v1<br>
        Sofle v1 is a very cool keyboard, it has a similar design to Ergodox, but it is smaller, easier to carry around, and it has two OLED screens and two knobs, this is the one that I am currently using. It also supports *low-profile switches!<br>
 
        Dactyl-ManuForm<br>
        The third one is Dactyl-ManuForm, this one is designed heavily on ergonomics. It is very similar to Ergodox but curved. I am currently building it. This one is harder to build. Because of the curving design, no PCB can fit this design. To connect each row and column, we need to wire them up all by hand, which required advanced knowledge of the keyboard. Not recommended for newbies. This one is also the most expensive to build. I spent more than $300 on it.<br>

      <h3>Keyboard Layouts</h3>
      <p>
        Intro<br>
        Okay, let's talk about Keyboard Layout. The layout on most keyboards is called "Qwerty". You can see this name from the top left corner of the keyboard, from left to right, first 6 keys. This is a very weird layout. While typing in English, your hands move all over the place. The reason that qwerty was designed was also because of typewriters. In the beginning, the typewriter's layout was designed in alphabetical order. But they soon learned that in the order, it was easy to get jammed. Christopher Latham Sholes invented the Qwerty layout for the typewriter back in 1866. The main purpose of this layout was to separate the commonly use letters from each other, so the typewriter won't easily jam. The price is to sacrifice some speed of typing.<br>
 
        Nowadays, Qwerty has become the "standard" of the keyboard. It is the default layout on your keyboard. This is probably the layout that you are using. If you felt the pain of typing, but do not want to spend money on a very expensive ergonomic design keyboard. Then learning a new layout might help you a little bit. It is free, some of them are even built into your computer. I am only going to introduce the two most popular ones, "Dvorak" and "Colemak".<br>
 
        Dvorak<br>
        In 1936, Dr. August Dvorak brought us a new keyboard layout, the "Dvorak" layout. This layout is focused on typing fast and efficiently. He put the most common use letters in the home row (which is the row where your fingers are situated, when you put your fingers on a keyboard). The problem is this layout is almost completely different than Qwerty. So if you want to use this, you will need to re-learn how to type again. Which will slow you down at the beginning and most of the shortcut keys won't work anymore.<br>
 
        Colemak<br>
        Colemak, a newer layout that came out in 2006 by Shai Colemak. This layout is also focusing on making you type fast and more efficiently. However, this one is a lot like Qwerty, only has 17 changes from qwerty. It keeps most of the shortcut keys and makes it easier to switch from qwerty to Colemak. I am using Colemak myself. It didn't take me long to switch from Qwerty to Colemak.<br>
 
        Comparison<br>
        The picture down below is the picture of the most used keys' heatmap. You can see that Qwerty is all over the place. Besides typing faster, putting the most used letters on the home row would also help your finger to feel less stressed. Because you don't need to move your finger all over the place anymore.<br>
